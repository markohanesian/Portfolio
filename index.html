        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="C:\Users\mso87\markohanesian.github.io\markohanesian.github.io\assets\images\1P0A3399.jpg" alt="Mark Profile Photo" height="200" width="200">
        <p>My name is Mark and I'm hoping to become a web developer wizard here at UC Davis Coding Boot Camp! I'm currently working at Sacramento State University as a Systems Analyst
            and do freelance photography and videography. I'm married to an amazing woman, my wife Stella, and we are expecting our first baby this February. 

            When I'm not working or doing photography, I play music, video games, and other things. I love creative things! Making stuff out of wood, wire jewelry, painting, designing
            marketing visuals, and whatever else I can. 

            I hope to use my skills in this class for getting a junior web developer career, and doing freelance web design work.
